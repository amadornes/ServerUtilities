Framez
======

Framez is a mod that attempts to add the frames that RedPower2 added back in 1.4.7.
It has full support for Forge MultiPart meaning you can place covers and panels on all six sides and you can even run tubes/conduits/cables inside the frame itself.
It's built around a custom movement API that's really easy to implement and allows for a lot of customizability. Most modded blocks should work right away but if some block doesn't just report it as an issue and I'll try to add support for it or get in touch with the mod author so he/she implements my API.
